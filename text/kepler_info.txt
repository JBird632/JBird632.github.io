Kepler will be one of the most ambitious maps to date. Kepler takes place in the distant future, with the setting 
revolved around space travel and different evironments. The map is mean't to have a huge sense of scale, yet 
still traversable in many ways. Players find themselves on a spaceship in search for new life, and the hopes to 
find a planet suitable for the migration of the human race. In this twisted future, Earth is slowly dying and on 
the verge of running out of researches. People suffer from famine and water is a commodity. We have become
