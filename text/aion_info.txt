<b>LOG</b>
Our search for a habitable planet lead us to the discovery of a small Red planet similar to that of Mars. 
Unfortunately, the land is barren and contains little to no visible life. Gravity is manageable but may 
cause spinal compression with long exposure of the intense pressure. Due to the circumstance of limited time,
the <b>Red Desert Planet</b> has been officially given the alias of Aion - after the Greek deity of time. 
Let's hope we find a planet suitable for life soon, we don't have much time.
